# QR Code Printing Guidelines

## Size Requirements

- **Minimum size:** 2" x 2" (5cm x 5cm)
- **Recommended size:** 3" x 3" (7.5cm x 7.5cm) for better scanning
- **Distance scanning:** Larger codes can be scanned from farther away

## Design Specifications

### Color Contrast
- **Best:** Black QR code on white background
- **Acceptable:** Dark blue/navy on white, or white on black
- **Avoid:** Low contrast combinations, multiple colors

### Error Correction
Use error correction level **M (Medium)** or higher to handle:
- Minor damage/scratches
- Weather wear
- Partial coverage

### Quiet Zone
- Maintain a **4-module quiet zone** (white border) around the QR code
- This is critical for accurate scanning

## Material & Durability

### Recommended Materials
- **Laminated vinyl** for outdoor signs
- **Weather-resistant adhesive labels**
- **Metal signs** with printed/etched QR codes
- **Acrylic** for permanent installations

### Protection
- Laminate outdoor signs
- Use UV-resistant ink/print
- Consider protective coating for high-traffic areas
- Test durability in your specific climate conditions

## Placement Tips

1. **Height:** Place at comfortable scanning height (3-5 feet / 1-1.5 meters)
2. **Angle:** Flat or slightly tilted, avoid severe angles
3. **Lighting:** Ensure adequate lighting, avoid shadows
4. **Coverage:** Protect from snow, ice buildup
5. **Visibility:** Place where guests naturally look (trail maps, lift towers, buildings)

## Testing

Before final installation:

1. Print a test copy
2. Test with multiple phone cameras:
   - iPhone camera
   - Android camera
   - Third-party QR scanners
3. Test in various lighting conditions
4. Test from different distances
5. Test with scratched/damaged test copies

## QR Code Generation

### Tools
- [QR Code Generator](https://www.qr-code-generator.com/)
- [QR Code Monkey](https://www.qrcode-monkey.com/)
- Online tools or libraries

### Settings
- **Error Correction:** Medium (M) or High (H)
- **Encoding:** UTF-8 (for text values)
- **Format:** PNG or SVG (high resolution)
- **Size:** At least 1000x1000 pixels for printing

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Scanning fails:**
- QR code too small
- Poor contrast
- Missing quiet zone
- Code damaged/worn
- Poor lighting

**GPS validation fails:**
- Verify coordinates are accurate
- Check decimal precision (6+ decimal places)
- Test at actual sign location

## Maintenance

- Regular inspection for damage
- Replace damaged codes immediately
- Keep spare QR codes for quick replacement
- Document sign locations for easy maintenance
